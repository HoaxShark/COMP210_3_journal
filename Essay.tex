	\abstract{This paper sums up a few HCI research methods. Afterwards going on to select one most relevant for a research study regarding a student made alternative controller and game.}
	
	\section{Introduction}
		This paper will be detailing some research into Human-Computer Interaction research methods. It will begin by detailing a few selected methods and then go into detail about one of the previously selected methods. The purpose is to provide a solid grasp on how to implement the chosen method successfully and use the data it collects correctly. All considerations of the possible usability of these methods will be in regard to them being used to test a university students alternative controller and game.
		
	\section{Methods}
		A research method provides a way of collecting data. There are two types of data quantitative and qualitative. "Qualitative research is empirical research where the data are not in the form of numbers"\citep{punch2013introduction} where as "Quantitative research gathers data in a numerical form which can be put into categories, or in rank order, or measured in units of measurement."\cite{simplePsych1}. Methods can provide a mix of these data types or one specifically.

	\subsection{Surveys}
		A survey is a list of questions given to a sample of a particular group of people with the aim of extracting specific data from them. They are good at quickly and easily collecting data, but if not written well they can provide bad data\citep{litwin1995measure}. A test should be sent out before fully implementing the survey to catch any mistakes. 
		
	\subsection{Task Analysis}
		Task analysis as a method of research, lists set tasks for the user to complete and measures set aspects of how they do when trying to complete the task.   This requires more interaction from the researcher as they will be present to monitor how the user manages with the tasks\citep{diaper2003handbook}.
		
	\subsection{A/B Testing}
		A/B testing takes a minimum of two versions of the product to be tested. The idea is that users are given the different versions to see the difference between the two and what one works better. This type of testing is used widely web page design\citep{azevedo2018b} as with the right tools it is easy to gather huge amounts of data cheaply even for small changes.
		
	\section{Task Analysis}
		Given the quick break downs of the research methods, task analysis was chosen to be looked into with more depth. With the controller being a physical product that then controls a game, it will be more interesting to see how people with no concept of the product are able to adapt to using it. Setting tasks such as "how long it takes the user to equip the controller" will give an insight into how easy it is to understand without prior knowledge.
